# Audiobooks-business-case

## Problem
We are given data from an Audiobook app. Logically, it relates only to the audio versions of books. 
Each customer in the database has made a purchase at least once, that's why he/she is in the database. 
The problem is to create a machine learning algorithm based on our available data that can predict if 
a customer will buy again from the Audiobook company.
